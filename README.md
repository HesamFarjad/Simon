# Simon





The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. Here's a breakdown of how your JavaScript code implements the Simon game:
Variables
* buttonColours: An array containing the colors available in the game.
* gamePattern: An array that stores the randomly generated pattern of colors by the game.
* userClickedPattern: An array that stores the pattern of colors clicked by the user.
* started: A boolean variable indicating whether the game has started or not.
* level: An integer variable representing the current level of the game.
Event Handlers
* $(document).keydown: This event handler starts the game when any key is pressed for the first time.
* $(".btn").click: This event handler triggers when a button with the class btn is clicked. It records the color clicked by the user, plays the corresponding sound, and checks if the user's sequence matches the game's pattern.
Functions
* nextSequence(): Generates the next color in the game pattern, updates the level display, and plays the corresponding sound and animation.
* playSound(name): Plays the sound associated with the provided color name.
* animatePress(currentColour): Adds and removes a CSS class to create a pressed effect on the button.
* checkAnswer(currentLevel): Checks if the user's recent answer matches the game pattern. If the user completes the sequence, it triggers the next sequence. If the answer is wrong, it ends the game.
* startOver(): Resets the game variables to their initial state when the game is over.
Explanation
* The game starts when any key is pressed for the first time.
* Each time a button is clicked, the color is added to the userClickedPattern.
* The checkAnswer() function verifies if the user's pattern matches the game's pattern.
* If the user completes the sequence correctly, the game proceeds to the next level.
* If the user makes a mistake, the game ends, and the startOver() function resets the game.
* Sounds and animations are played to provide feedback to the user.
